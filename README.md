# Neural_Network_Architecture_Comparision
This projects aims at implementation and training of different orientations and types of Neural Networks with respect to Mathematical equations and problems ranging from a simple straight forward equation to a bit complex equations in nature too. Following a comparative study on how different architectures react with these problems.
