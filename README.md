# Neural_Network_Architecture_Comparision

## Project AIM
The following projects aims at implementation and training of different orientations and types of Neural Networks 
with respect to Mathematical equations and problems ranging from a simple straight forward equation to a bit complex equations in nature too.

Some examples of Mathematical equations:-
1) a+b
2) a!
3) ∫a²cos(a)
4) and many more.

Some examples of Neural Network orientations/architectures:-
1) Perceptron
2) Feed Forward Neural networks
3) Convolutional neural networks
4) and many more.

Then doing the comparitive study on how different architectures react with these problems and which architectures are better in general for solving such problems.
