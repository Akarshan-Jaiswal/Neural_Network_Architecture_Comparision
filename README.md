# Title: Evaluation and Comparison of Neural Network Architectures for Evaluating Linear and Non-Linear Mathematical Models

**Abstract**

This projects aims at implementation and training of different types and orientation of Neural
Network architectures with respect to different Mathematical equations and problems.
Following a comparative study on how different architectures react with different sets of Math-
ematical equations/problems.
These Mathematical problems range from a simple straight forward equation
(e.g. [a + b = c] ) to a bit complex equations (e.g. [∫ a2cos(a) = b] ) in nature too.
As Neural networks play an extremely important role in today’s landscape of AI and Data
Science tools. Hence, understanding the underlying capability of these Algorithms under dif-
ferent architectures becomes extremely important. The following thesis aims at exposing the
underlying mathematical equations that drive these different architectures, including Percep-
trons, Feed-Forward neural networks, Multi-Layer Feed-Forward neural networks, Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNN) and many more.
Additionally, this thesis explores the impact of different architectures on the Neural net-
works ability to recognize/capture complex patterns and generalize problems effectively. This
also investigates the adaptability of the following network architectures towards various math-
ematical problems, while shining light on their fitness for different applications.
The final outcomes of this research provide valuable insights to the selection and design of
neural network architectures based on their mathematical traits of the problem one is trying to
solve. As the field of deep learning continues to improve, this thesis aims to guide all researchers
and scholars in making informed decisions regarding the choice of neural network architectures
for any given problem, thereby progressing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence and data
science.

## Overview

**Aims**
The following projects aims at implementation and training of different orientations and types of Neural Networks 
with respect to Mathematical equations and problems ranging from a simple straight forward equation to a bit complex equations in nature too.

Some examples of Mathematical equations:-
1) a+b
2) a!
3) ∫a²cos(a)
4) and many more.

Some examples of Neural Network orientations/architectures:-
1) Perceptron
2) Feed Forward Neural networks
3) Convolutional neural networks
4) and many more.

Then doing the comparitive study on how different architectures react with these problems and which architectures are better in general for solving such problems.
