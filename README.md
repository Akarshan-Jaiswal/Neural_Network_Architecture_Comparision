# Neural_Network_Architecture_Comparision
The following projects aims at implementation and training of different orientations and types of Neural Networks 
with respect to Mathematical equations and problems ranging from a simple straight forward equation to a bit complex equations in nature too.

Some examples of Mathematical equations:-
1) a+b
2) a!
:.....................:
n) ∫a²cos(a)
n+1) and many more.

Some examples of Neural Network orientations/architectures:-
1) Perceptron
2) Feed Forward Neural networks
:.....................:
n) Convolutional neural networks
n+1) and many more.

Then doing the comparitive study on how different architectures react with these problems and which architectures are better in general for solving such problems.
